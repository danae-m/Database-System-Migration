# school-projects

This repository holds the code from my projects and performance assessments
created as a computer science student at Western Governors University.

Each project and code sample herein received a passing score on all parts of
the grading rubric. Sometimes the project guidelines were not the best way to
accomplish the task, but I was able to meet the school's expectations anyway.
